# CreditCard-Fraud-Detection

The objective of this project is to create a simple Logistic Regression model capable of detecting fraud in credit card operations, thus seeking to minimize the risk and loss of the business. The biggest challenge is to create a model that is very sensitive to fraud, since most transactions are legitimate, making detection difficult.
